## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure functionality by writing detailed unit tests for every requirement and edge case, using JUnit to verify both expected success and failure scenarios. I ensure security by validating all inputs at the object and service levels, preventing invalid or harmful data from entering the system.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by translating each requirement into specific, testable features within my code. I validate that the program behavior matches the userâ€™s expectations by building modular classes, and writing tests that directly verify business rules.

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by focusing first on understanding the problem, then creating simple domain models that clearly represent real-world objects. I focus on separation of concerns, maintainable code structure, and defensive programming practices to ensure that the software is scalable, reliable, and easy to extend.
